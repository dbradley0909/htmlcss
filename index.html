    <h3><strong>Part A: Structures and Mechanisms<br/>Fifth Edition</strong></h3>
    <img src=””>
    <p>This book begins by reviewing the familiar Lewis stuctures approach to structure and
        bonding. Lewis’s concept of bond pairing,  <br/> as extended by adding the ideas of
        hybridization and resonance, plus fundamental atomic properties <br/>  such as electroneg-
        ativity and polarizabilion provide a solid foundation for qualitative descriptions of
        trends in reactivity. <br/> In polar reactions, for example, the molecular properties of acidity,
        basicity, nucleophilicity, and electrophilicity can all be related to information  <br/> embodied
        in Lewis structures. It also talks about computational methods can often provide insight
        into reaction mechanisms </h2>
    <p> It informs the reader about the two structural levels of stereochemistry—
        configuration and conformation.Molecular conformation is important  <br/> in its own right,
        but can also influence reactivity.The structural relationships between stereoisomers and
        the origin and consequences of molecular chirality are discussed.  <br/> After reviewing the
        classical approach to resolving racemic mixtures, modern methods for chromatographic <br/> 
        separation and kinetic resolution are described. The chapter also explores how stereo-
        chemistry affects reactivity with examples of  <br/> diastereoselective and enantioselective
        reactions, especially those involving addition to carbonyl groups.</p>
    <p> The book covers the application of thermodynamics and kinetics to organic chemistry,
        <br/>which has been reorganized to place emphasis on structural effects on stability <br/>and reactivity.
        This particular chapter lays the groundwork for later chapters by <br/>considering stability effects on
        carbocations, carbanions, radicals, and carbonyl compounds.</p>
